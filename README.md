For main writeup see this reddit post:

You can find the data I used here [link]. In the code, you can see that I actually compared game totals (e.g., sum of all plays) along with looking at the average stat for each play. To keep the text streamlined, I didn’t mention both variants, instead pointing out the one that more people have an intuition for.

I couldn’t find any significant differences between main vs. backup QBs in terms of play type (e.g., shotgun, scramble, etc.).

I simplified my description of effect sizes. In reality, I performed paired sample statistics on every team, and so basic Cohen’s D isn’t appropriate here. I instead used “Cohen’s dav,” which is very similar. You can read about this more in this paper (Lakens et al., 2017).
